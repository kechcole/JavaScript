    <h1>Events in JS.</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Introduction.</h2>

    <p>
        Although at this point we can now make almost any change we want to
        the DOM, from a user perspective it is not very helpful because we have
        only manually triggered changes. By learning about events, we will
        understand how to tie everything together to make interactive websites.
        <br>
        Events are actions taking place at the browser that are initiated
        by the user or the browser itself. Some common examples inclde ;

    <ul>
        <li>User clicking a button</li>
        <li>User hovering a mouse.</li>
        <li>User submitting a form.</li>
        <li>User pressing a key on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>A page finishes loading.</li>
    </ul>

    By writing JS sripts that response to these events, developers
    can customise messages to be displayed, valdate information,
    react and many more. Lets cover event listeners, event handlers,
    and event objects as this will give you more manouverability
    in developing interactive web experiences for end users.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2 Event Handlers and Listeners.</h2>

    <p>
        Developers can create triggers that fire an event(action) when
        userc click a button or press a key. Such events are commonly
        reffered to as keypress or click events. An <b>event handler</b>
        is basically a JavaScript function that executes when an event fires.
        While an <b>event listener</b> attaches a responsive interface
        to an element. It allows a particilar element to wait and listen
        for a event event to fire. <br>
        There are 3 ways in which we can assign events events to elements.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Inline Event handler</li>
        <li>Event Handler Properties.</li>
        <li>Event Listeners</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> (a) Inline Event Handler. </h3>

    <p>
        Consider a button element that when a user clicks it changes the
        text content of paragraph below. Directly on the button we will add
        an attribute called <i>onclick</i>, its value is a function called
        <em>changeText()</em>, that will be hosted in a JS file in our directory.
        <br>
        <br>

        <!-- Button with attribute containing a function -->
        <button onclick="changeText()">Click</button>

    <p>Change Me.</p>


    <br>
    <br>

    Inline event handlers are easier to understand but the only downtime to
    them is that they become tedious to maintain when they are many, compare
    to CSS inline stylers. It more practical and feasible to maintain a
    separate stylesheet of classes than being added independently to every
    element.

    </p>

    <h3> (b) Event Handler Properties. </h3>

    <p>

        Works similar to inline event handler except that it's element property
        is set in a JavaScript file instead of the attribute in HTML.
        We will set up a similar feature as previous but this time onclick
        attribute wont be in the markup. Our function will also remain similar
        only that it will be accessed from the JS file also. <br>
        <i>
            <b>
                Event handlers do not follow the camelCase convention that most
                JavaScript code adheres to. Notice that the code in JS file is
                onclick, not onClick.

            </b>
        </i>

        <br>
        <br>

        <button>Click me</button> <br>

    <p>I will change.</p>

    <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The event handler property is slightly more maintainable than inline handler
        but still suffers some setback. Example, trying to set multiple,
        separate <i>onclick</i> properties will cause all but the last one to be
        overwritten, as demonstrated below. Try change the colour and the textual content.
        <br>
        <br>

        <button>Click me</button>
    <p>Change Me again.</p>

    <br>
    The text colour event was not fired, only text content effected, the
    last one.
    </p>

    <h3> (c) Event Listeners. </h3>

    <p>
        This is the newest addition to JavaScript event handlers. This is how it works.
        An event listener watches for an event on an element. Instead of assigning the
        event directly to the property of an element, we will use <i>addEventListener()</i>
        method to listen for an event. <br>
        The method takes two parameters, first is the event it is to be listening for and
        the listener callback function.
        <br>

        <button>Click me.</button>
    <p>Change me again.</p> <br>

    Notice that with the first two methods, a click event was referred to as
    <i>onclick</i>, but with event listeners it is referred to as <i>click</i>. Every event
    listener drops the <i>on</i> from the word. <br>

    Advantages of of event listeners.
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Multiple elements can be changed.</li>
        <li>Multiple events can be set on the same element.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h4> (d) Event Listeners with Anonymous function. </h4>

    <p>
        Often, anonymous functions will be used instead of a function reference
        on an event listener. Anonymous functions are functions that are not
        named. It is also possible to use the <i>EventListener()</i> function to
        remove one or all events from an element.
        <br>

    <p>Change me</p>
    <button>Click Me</button>
    </p>

    <h2>1.3. Common Events.</h2>

    <p>
        We have learned about inline event handlers, event handler properties, and
        event listeners using the click event, but there are many more events in
        JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3> (a) Mouse Events.</h3>

    <p>
        These are among the most frequently used events. They refers to those
        events that involve clicking buttons on the mouse or hovering and
        moving the mouse pointer.
        <br>

    <ul>
        <u style="margin-left: 30px;"><i>Event</i> - Description</u>
        <li><i>click</i> - Fires when mouse is pressed and released on an element</li>
        <li><i>dblclick</i> - Fires when an element is clicked twice</li>
        <li><i>mouseenter</i> - Fires when a pointer enters an element</li>
        <li><i>mouseleave</i> - Fires when a pointer leaves an element</li>
        <li><i>mousemove</i> - Fires when a pointer moves inside an element</li>
    </ul>

    Using mouseenter and mouseleave in tandem recreates a hover
    effect that lasts as long as a mouse pointer is on the element.
    </p>

    <h3> (b) Form Events.</h3>

    <p>
        Form events are actions that pertain to forms, such as input elements
        being selected or unselected, and forms being submitted.
        JavaScript is often used to submit forms and send the values through to
        a backend language. The advantage of using JavaScript to send forms is
        that it does not require a page reload to submit the form, and JavaScript
        can be used to validate required input fields
    </p>

    <h3> (c) Keyboard Events.</h3>

    <p>
        They are used for handlng Keyboard activities such as pressing a key,
        lifting a key, and holding down a key.
