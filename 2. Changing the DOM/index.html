    <h1>1. Changing the DOM.</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Creating New Nodes</h2>
    <p id="first">
        There are various ways in which the DOM can be changed. Static websites require one
        to directly change elements in the HTML file but dynamic websites are use JS. <br>
        A combination of createElement() method and textContent property will give you a textual
        content. But these new features are not visible in the front end of the web browser until
        when they are inserted.
        With a combination of appendChild(), insertBefore(), and replaceChild(), you can insert nodes
        and elements anywhere in the DOM.
    </p>
    <script>
        // Create a new paragraph element node. 
        const paragraph2 = document.createElement('p');
        console.log(paragraph2);   // <p></p> , an empty paragraph is out put in the console.

        // Add text to the new paragraph, remember textContent is NOT a function 
        paragraph2.textContent = 'New paragrapgh that has been created by colllins.';
        // <p>New paragrapgh that has been created by colllins.<p>
        // paragraph created

        // Alternate method , NOT recomended.
        paragraph2.innerHTML = 'Second paragraph created by Kech_Cole.';


        // Create a text node 
        const newText = document.createTextNode('Coles first text node.');
        console.log(newText);  // Coles first text node.   
                                // No tags in output.
    </script>

    <h2>1.2 Inserting Nodes into the DOM</h2>
    <p>
        We need to insert created elements and nodes into the document for it to be seen by either adding
        or replacing.
    </p>
    <script>
        // Apppend newText to the end and beginning of paragraph 1 with id 'first'

        // Step 1. Access the paragraph object.
        const firstPara = document.getElementById('first');
        console.log(firstPara);

        // Create paragraph object 
        const newText2 = document.createTextNode("This just got added by KechCole.");

        // Append 
        firstPara.append(newText2);
    </script>

    <h2>1.3 Removing Nodes from the DOM.</h2>
    <p>
        Now we know how to create elements, add them to the DOM, and modify existing elements. 
        The final step is to learn to remove existing nodes from the DOM. Child nodes can be removed 
        from a parent with removeChild(), and a node itself can be removed with remove().
